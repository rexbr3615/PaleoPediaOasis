                Proterozoic Eon – the third large eon, which covers times just before the proliferation of complex life on Earth. The most important events of this time were the transition to an oxygenated atmosphere, several global glaciations (the Snowball Earth hypothesis), and the evolution of soft-bodied, multicellular organisms.
This is a hypothetical reconstruction of a Snowball Earth during the Huronian and Cryogenian glaciations.

                    The Great Oxidation Event was the biologically induced appearance of oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere which happened around 2.5 billion years ago. The general hypothesis states that the main cause of this event was the development of oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria.
Before this event, any free oxygen was chemically captured by dissolved iron or organic matter, but once these oxygen sinks became saturated, oxygen was free to escape into atmosphere.
Free oxygen is toxic to obligate anaerobic organisms, so this event caused their mass extinction. Additionally, oxygen reacted with atmospheric methane, greatly reducing its concentration and triggering Huronian glaciation, which lasted about 300 million years (2400–2100 mya).
These tremendous changes in Earth’s chemical interactions provided a new opportunity for biological diversification, as life adapted to tolerate and then take advantage of atmospheric oxygen. This breakthrough in metabolic evolution greatly increased the free energy supply to living organisms, allowing the creation of new, more complex morphologies.

            The Ediacaran (/ˌiːdiˈækərən/; formerly Vendian) biota is a taxonomic period classification that consists of all life forms that were present on Earth during the Ediacaran Period (c. 635–538.8 Mya). These were composed of enigmatic tubular and frond-shaped, mostly sessile, organisms.[1][2] Trace fossils of these organisms have been found worldwide, and represent the earliest known complex multicellular organisms.[note 1]

            The Ediacaran biota may have undergone evolutionary radiation in a proposed event called the Avalon explosion, 575 million years ago.[3][4] This was after the Earth had thawed from the Cryogenian period's extensive glaciation. This biota largely disappeared with the rapid increase in biodiversity known as the Cambrian explosion. Most of the currently existing body plans of animals first appeared in the fossil record of the Cambrian rather than the Ediacaran. For macroorganisms, the Cambrian biota appears to have almost completely replaced the organisms that dominated the Ediacaran fossil record, although relationships are still a matter of debate.
            
            The organisms of the Ediacaran Period first appeared around 600 million years ago and flourished until the cusp of the Cambrian 538.8 million years ago, when the characteristic communities of fossils vanished. A diverse Ediacaran community was discovered in 1995 in Sonora, Mexico, and is approximately 555 million years in age, roughly coeval with Ediacaran fossils of the Ediacara Hills in South Australia and the White Sea on the coast of Russia.[5][6][7] While rare fossils that may represent survivors have been found as late as the Middle Cambrian (510 to 500 million years ago), the earlier fossil communities disappear from the record at the end of the Ediacaran leaving only curious fragments of once-thriving ecosystems.[8] Multiple hypotheses exist to explain the disappearance of this biota, including preservation bias, a changing environment, the advent of predators and competition from other life-forms. A sampling, reported in 2018, of late Ediacaran strata across Baltica (<560 mya) suggests the flourishing of the organisms coincided with conditions of low overall productivity with a very high percentage produced by bacteria, which may have led to high concentrations of dissolved organic material in the oceans.[9]
            
            Determining where Ediacaran organisms fit in the tree of life has proven challenging; it is not even established that most of them were animals, with suggestions that they were lichens (fungus-alga symbionts), algae, protists known as foraminifera, fungi or microbial colonies, or hypothetical intermediates between plants and animals.[10] The morphology and habit of some taxa (e.g. Funisia dorothea) suggest relationships to Porifera or Cnidaria (e.g. Auroralumina).[11][12][13] Kimberella may show a similarity to molluscs, and other organisms have been thought to possess bilateral symmetry, although this is controversial. Most macroscopic fossils are morphologically distinct from later life-forms: they resemble discs, tubes, mud-filled bags or quilted mattresses. Due to the difficulty of deducing evolutionary relationships among these organisms, some palaeontologists have suggested that these represent completely extinct lineages that do not resemble any living organism. Palaeontologist Adolf Seilacher proposed a separate subkingdom level category Vendozoa (now renamed Vendobionta)[14] in the Linnaean hierarchy for the Ediacaran biota. If these enigmatic organisms left no descendants, their strange forms might be seen as a "failed experiment" in multicellular life, with later multicellular life evolving independently from unrelated single-celled organisms.[15] A 2018 study confirmed that one of the period's most-prominent and iconic fossils, Dickinsonia, included cholesterol,[16] suggesting affinities to animals, fungi, or red algae.[17]
            
            The concept of "Ediacaran Biota" is somewhat artificial as it cannot be defined geographically, stratigraphically, taphonomically, or biologically.[18]

            This eon represents the evolution of life from simple to more complex forms. During the Great Oxidation Event most of the anaerobic organisms were replaced by more advanced protista and bacteria. By halfway through the eon, stromatolites saw their greatest diversity, and the ancestors of fungi diverged from the ancestors of animals. By the Ediacaran (635 mya), the first advanced, soft bodied multicellular organisms had appeared.
