                The Archean Eon ( /ɑːrˈkiːən/ ar-KEE-ən, also spelled Archaean or Archæan) is the second of four geologic eons of Earth's history, representing the time from 4,000 to 2,500 million years ago. The Archean was preceded by the Hadean Eon and followed by the Proterozoic.

The Earth during the Archean was mostly a water world: there was continental crust, but much of it was under an ocean deeper than today's ocean. Except for some trace minerals, today's oldest continental crust dates back to the Archean. Much of the geological detail of the Archean has been destroyed by subsequent activity. The earliest known life started in the Archean. Life was simple throughout the Archean, mostly represented by shallow-water microbial mats called stromatolites, and the atmosphere lacked free oxygen.

            Unlike in the Hadean, the existence of life during the Archean is not in doubt, although there are disputes about the time life first appeared.
            The first solid evidence of life comes from the 3.85-billion-year-old banded iron formations found in Greenland. These formations require oxygen for their formation, and the only source of oxygen during that time was photosynthesis, so the existence of these formations is direct evidence of life.
            Possible first prokaryotes have been found in Canadian rocks that are at least 3.77 billion years old, and by judging lipid biomarkers, the first eukaryotes might have appeared by the end of the period, about 2.7 billion years ago.
