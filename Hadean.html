                The Hadean ( /heɪˈdiːən, ˈheɪdiən/ hay-DEE-ən, HAY-dee-ən) is a geologic eon of Earth history preceding the Archean. On Earth, the Hadean began with the planet's formation about 4.54 billion years ago[1][2] (although the start of the Hadean is defined as the age of the oldest solid material in the Solar System, found in some meteorites, about 4.567 billion years old).[3] The Hadean ended, as defined by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), 4 billion years ago.[4] As of 2016, the ICS describes its status as "informal".[5]

                Hadean rocks are very rare, largely consisting of zircons from one locality in Western Australia.[6] Hadean geophysical models remain controversial among geologists: it appears that plate tectonics and the growth of continents may have started in the Hadean.[6] Earth in the early Hadean had a very thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, but eventually oceans of liquid water formed.

                    In the last decades of the 20th-century geologists identified a few Hadean rocks from western Greenland, northwestern Canada, and Western Australia. In 2015, traces of carbon minerals interpreted as "remains of biotic life" were found in 4.1-billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[14][15]

                    The oldest dated zircon crystals, enclosed in a metamorphosed sandstone conglomerate in the Jack Hills of the Narryer Gneiss Terrane of Western Australia, date to 4.404 ± 0.008 Ga.[16] This zircon is a slight outlier, with the oldest consistently-dated zircon falling closer to 4.35 Ga[16]—around 200 million years after the hypothesized time of Earth's formation.
                    
                    In many other areas, xenocryst (or relict) Hadean zircons enclosed in older rocks indicate that younger rocks have formed on older terranes and have incorporated some of the older material. One example occurs in the Guiana shield from the Iwokrama Formation of southern Guyana where zircon cores have been dated at 4.22 Ga.[17]
