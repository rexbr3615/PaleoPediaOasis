                The Hadean ( /heɪˈdiːən, ˈheɪdiən/ hay-DEE-ən, HAY-dee-ən) is a geologic eon of Earth history preceding the Archean. On Earth, the Hadean began with the planet's formation about 4.54 billion years ago[1][2] (although the start of the Hadean is defined as the age of the oldest solid material in the Solar System, found in some meteorites, about 4.567 billion years old).[3] The Hadean ended, as defined by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), 4 billion years ago.[4] As of 2016, the ICS describes its status as "informal".[5]

                Hadean rocks are very rare, largely consisting of zircons from one locality in Western Australia.[6] Hadean geophysical models remain controversial among geologists: it appears that plate tectonics and the growth of continents may have started in the Hadean.[6] Earth in the early Hadean had a very thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, but eventually oceans of liquid water formed.
